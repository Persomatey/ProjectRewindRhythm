<summary>Summary</summary>
<blockquote>
	
Our theme is an autorunner platformer rhythm game where the player needs to perform certain actions like jumping to the beat of the song. The catch is that the player has to perform these actions... in reverse! Instead of jumping, the player needs to time their lands, etc. </i> 

<i>The game has bee sumitted to itch.io and the game jam 25 minutes, 20 seconds before the deadline </i>
